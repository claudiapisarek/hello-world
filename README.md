### <span style="color:#045FB4"> A New Beginning for Claudia Pisarek 

> I am a third year Commerce student pursuing a career in finance and international business. Here's a quick overview of myself. I am a born and raised Vancouverite (techincally Coquitlam, but we'll count as Greater Vancouver as it is one of the greatest cities) I am a complete animal lover - _the weirder and softer, the better._ My dream travel destination is Barcelona, Spain but also majority of European cities. My favourite past time is enjoying a strong cup of coffee, a sweet treat and laughing at corny jokes with family and friends.

<p> I have always liked concepts that strive to explain the world in a universal method. Learning these tools of data management and coding as well will provide me with the possibilities to do so. There were some steps I needed to take to get started... </p>

1. Download all the required software
    - R 
    - R studio 
    - Git
2. Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account 
3. Create a new Repository
4. Connect R Studio to Github in order to be able to access and store all the files

<p> Whenever you open R Studio to work on your project, you should **Pull** in order to receive the most up-to-date version that was uploaded to GitHub. Then, starting working! Once you are finished, click **Commit** in order to 'lock in' your work. Then, **Push** your work which will put it on the repository on GitHub.</p>

<p> But most importantly, my outlook for this workshop series - _as overused as this photo is_ - can be summed up by ![this](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8DnlWLEqdR4/U3YlbyuvEyI/AAAAAAAAI0A/gHc_Dx6XaFY/s1600/Clenched_fist_baby.png) </p>
